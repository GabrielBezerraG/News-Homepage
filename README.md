## My Process
I developed this application using React. The main component is a stateful class component that has a property controlling the visibility of the sidebar. The other components are simple stateless components representing each part of the page. I used map for rendering sibling components on the Top3 component and passed object properties containing their info as props. Using CSS Grid was essential for matching the original design.
